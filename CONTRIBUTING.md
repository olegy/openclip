# Contributing to OpenClip

Thanks for wanting to help! OpenClip is a lightweight macOS utility that turns any
selected text into instant actions. Contributions come in many forms: bug reports,
documentation, extension packages, and code.

This file is the entry point for **code contributions**. The authoritative
engineering reference — hard design rules, architecture, and current-state debt —
lives in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the [`docs/`](docs/index.md) hub. Both are
required reading before touching code.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** macOS 14+, [Xcode 16+](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835),
[XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ganeshmshetty/openclip.git
cd openclip

# Generate the Xcode project (re-run after adding/removing .swift files)
xcodegen generate
```

`project.yml` is the source of truth for the Xcode project — the `.xcodeproj` is
generated and should not be edited by hand.

## Project layout

| Path | What it is |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Sources/Core` | Pure-domain framework: models, actions, rules, selection logic, settings, manifest parsers. **No `AppKit`/`SwiftUI`.** |
| `Sources/OpenClip` | App target: AppKit panels, SwiftUI views, platform side-effect handlers, AI providers, composition root. |
| `Tests/OpenClipTests` | XCTest suites for both targets. |
| `scripts/` | `dev_run`, `test`, `package_app`, `clean`, `install_extension` helpers. |
| `docs/` | Architecture, developer guide, runtimes, user guide, logging. |

Two directories in your working copy are **not part of this repository**: `Extensions/` is a
separate clone of the extension catalog, and `web/` is the marketing site. Both are gitignored
here, so `git ls-files` will not list them and nothing in either can be committed here. Extension
changes go to the [openclip-extensions](https://github.com/ganeshmshetty/openclip-extensions)
catalog.

## Development workflow

Prefer the `scripts/` wrappers over raw `xcodebuild`/`xcodegen`. Full list is in
`AGENTS.md` §2; the essentials:

| Task | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| Quick compile gate | `timeout -k 5 60 xcodebuild -project OpenClip.xcodeproj -scheme OpenClip -destination 'platform=macOS' build` |
| Core domain tests (<1s) | `./scripts/test.sh core` |
| Full test suite (0 skips) | `timeout -k 10 60 ./scripts/test.sh` |
| Single test class | `./scripts/test.sh SettingsStoreTests` |
| Run the app | `./scripts/dev_run.sh` |
| Package a Release | `./scripts/package_app.sh` |
| Clean build artifacts | `./scripts/clean.sh` |

Always run the quick build gate first, then the full suite once at the end. The
suite runs deterministically (~45 s) but still wrap it in a timeout.

## Code style & hard rules

These change behavior — keep them. (Condensed from `AGENTS.md` §4, which is the
authority; read it in full before editing.)

- **Module boundaries.** Never `import AppKit`/`SwiftUI` in `Sources/Core/Actions/`
  or `Sources/Core/Settings/`.
- **No `UserDefaults.standard`.** Use `SettingKey`/`SettingsStore`; production code
  goes through `DefaultSettingsStore.shared`. Tests inject the shared
  `MemorySettingsStore` test double or a per-test `DefaultSettingsStore(userDefaults: suiteName)`.
- **Data-driven UI.** Drive rendering from `action.chrome`,
  `ConfigurableAction.preferenceIconName`, and `action.gesturePolicy` — never
  `switch action.id`, Swift type checks, or hidden singleton wiring in Core.
- **Single `Log` surface.** Every log message goes through a category on the `Log`
  enum — never `print()`. Text, clipboard, and extension data stay default-private;
  hot paths (per-mouse-move hover, high-frequency view bodies) are never logged.
- **Swift 6 strict concurrency.** No captured mutable locals in continuation
  resume-once flags (use `@unchecked Sendable` classes like `TimeoutFlag`
  /`OnceGate`), and never `Self.<static>` inside a `Task.detached` closure — see
  `docs/runtimes/javascript.md`.
- **Subprocess actions need a timeout watchdog** that terminates past
  `Constants.scriptTimeout` (30 s), and read pipes via GCD `readabilityHandler` —
  never a blocking `readToEnd()`.
- **Test isolation.** Any test class touching app singletons
  (`ActionRegistry.shared`, `RuleEngine.shared`, `ExtensionManager.shared`,
  `ActionCustomizationManager.shared`) must call `TestIsolation.reset()` from
  `setUp()`.
- **Docs stay current.** After a meaningful batch of edits, refresh `AGENTS.md` and
  the docs it points to if they'd otherwise drift (`AGENTS.md` §6).

## Commit conventions

OpenClip uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Prefixes
in active use:

```
feat:  fix:  refactor:  docs:  chore:  style:  test:  ui:  log:  ext:  perf:
```

Keep messages focused and lowercase-scope where applicable (e.g. `feat(extensions):`).

## Submitting changes

1. **Open an issue first** for behavioral changes or anything design-sensitive;
   small fixes and docs can go straight to a PR.
2. **Add tests** when you change behavior, and make sure the quick build gate and
   full suite pass before pushing.
3. **Keep PRs focused** on a single concern. Rebase onto `main` before submitting.
4. **Update docs** (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/`) when you change behavior or add a
   convention — same commit is ideal.
5. In the PR description, describe the change and what you tested.

Extension authors: the extension format is documented in
[`Extensions/AGENTS.md`](Extensions/AGENTS.md) if you have the catalog cloned locally; the
authoritative version is the `AGENTS.md` at the root of
[openclip-extensions](https://github.com/ganeshmshetty/openclip-extensions).

## Filing issues and picking one up

Issues are the front door, so it's worth knowing what happens after you file one.

**What happens when you file an issue.** The form asks which subsystem is affected and how you
want to be involved. An automated pass applies an `area:*` label from that answer, flags the issue
for triage, greets you if this is your first issue, and — if the title is close enough to an
existing one — leaves a pointer to the possible duplicate. It does not close anything: duplicate
suggestions are hints, not verdicts.

**How to work on one.**

- Comment `/claim` on the issue. You'll be assigned and the issue gets a `claimed` label. One
  claim per issue — if someone beats you to it, you'll be told and invited to pair.
- Claims do **not** expire. If you stall, say so in a comment so someone else can take it, or ask a
  maintainer to release it.
- Saying "I'll send a pull request" or "I'd like to work on this" in the form gets the issue
  labelled accordingly, so the maintainer can see who wants to help before you start.

**Before you open the pull request.** `main` requires two checks to pass: `Build & Tests` and
`PR Intake`. The second one wants two things from you — a description that says what changed and
why, and a `Fixes #<number>` line. Your own description's verification checkboxes are treated as
claims, not results; the build is the actual gate.
